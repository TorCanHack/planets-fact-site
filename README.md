## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS 

### What I learned

I learned about `REACT ROUTER DOM`, which is a package is used to  handle routing in React Applications. The adavantage of using a React Router is that if you're using a single page application, it enables users to navigates through components as if they were pages thereby creating a smooth and fluid user experience, without refreshing the page.


### Continued development

I want to learn to use other packages that ehance user experience and accessibility.
